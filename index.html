                    <h3>Game 1</h3>
                    <p>You are on a continent called Never, in the country of Dunina. Lord Sigmund Usher, whose castle is in the Otranto forest, is having a party on midsummerâ€™s eve. All the nobles and performers in Never are invited.</p>

                    <p>A party composed of Gilda, Njairen, Finn, Eredor, and Anthea is walking through the Otranto forest road to reach the castle. As they approach the castle, on the left, they hear shouting and chanting coming from their right, deep in the woods. Confused, a few party members go in search of the source of the noise, but come across two guards. After some discussion, the guards are evaded, and the party continues forward to the party. </p>

                    <p>They arrive at the castle early, and see many nobles and performers chatting and moving around excitedly. An elf bard named Terrance is performing an opening for Anthea, who stole the show later that evening. The party discusses the three daughters of Lord Sigmund: Esmeralda, the outgoing sister; Tia, the bookish and kind sister; and Janeye, the mysterious third sister. Madam Eupheme, a noble of Sarunia was schmoozed by Anthea, but the whole party learned that cultists in the area are bothering her. This was further discussed with Esmeralda, who said that there was a cultist ritual happening in the forest north of the castle. She said that if they could be eliminated, she may be able to procure a reward for the party, seeing as we are well equipped for adventure, and well-known fighters, to boot.</p>

                    <p>Agreeing to take up the quest, the party leaves the castle, as the party is beginning and heads for the woods south of the castle, where shouting was heard before. Splitting up, Finn heads around the noise, behind it; Anthea and Eredor encounter more guards and stay by the road; and lastly, Gilda and Njiaren approach the voices.</p>

                    <p>Gilda, Njairen, and Finn see that there is a cultist ritual occurring, with tens of cultists surrounding a central shape drawn on the ground, and several guards encircling them. Finn notices that there is a hatch locked with magic on the far side of the circle, and returns to the group to report back. Once the party is reunited, they come across guads, who are not so willing to chat this time.</p>

                    <h3>Game 2</h3>
                    <p>Three guards were killed, and two were cast asleep. Philip, one of the sleeping guards, was woken and charmed. When questioned, he divulged that a cultist wearing red robes hired him and several others to protect the black-robed cultists in the center of the forest. The party, along with Philip, head towards the circle in the forest. As they walk, they hear Auriana Owlfeather fall from a tree with a squawk. It was revealed that she was spying on the group, and following her childhood friend, Anthea.</p>
                    <p>All together now, the party encroach on the circle of cultists. All are wearing black robes, and there are 20 or so surrounding a large summoning circle with Infernal writing. Two were knocked out by Athena cast lightning that stunned two people. Philip the newfie then followed the adventurers went down the trapdoor into the hideout of the cultists. The first room was entirely filled with crates, which were plundered by the adventurers and Phil. There was also a sleeping guard present, but he was narrowly avoided. Phil woke from his charmed state and decided to follow the others in order to get his bonus. The adventurers brave on, past a cultist office, dining room full of cultists, and onto a room with a sculpture in the corner.</p>

                    <h3>Game 3</h3>
                    <p>The group follow the hallways until they get to a large circular room. There is a ribbon of light dancing in the center. The group realize that they have come across a celestial being. While at a loss over what to do, Finras approaches the being in order to poke it. Everyone sees as Finras (and later Gilda) approach that a being made of light, is formed.</p>
                    <p>A cultist appears at the entrance, and asks if the "deity" was summoned. The party finds out that the Midsummer ceremony is meant to summon the North Witch, to protect the world from the Neverghast. Every year there is a different location where they do their ritual; they do not ask permission because they do not want to be disturbed, and they steal babies to train them to be cultists. Upset that many cultists were killed, this cultist snaps his fingers and causes the angel to approach the group.</p>
