                    <h3>Game 1</h3>
                    <p>You are on a continent called Never, in the country of Dunina. Lord Sigmund Usher, whose castle
                        is in the Otranto forest, is having a party on midsummerâ€™s eve. All the nobles and performers in
                        Never are invited.</p>

                    <p>A party composed of Gilda, Njairen, Finn, Eredor, and Anthea is walking through the Otranto
                        forest road to reach the castle. As they approach the castle, on the left, they hear shouting
                        and chanting coming from their right, deep in the woods. Confused, a few party members go in
                        search of the source of the noise, but come across two guards. After some discussion, the guards
                        are evaded, and the party continues forward to the party. </p>

                    <p>They arrive at the castle early, and see many nobles and performers chatting and moving around
                        excitedly. An elf bard named Terrance is performing an opening for Anthea, who stole the show
                        later that evening. The party discusses the three daughters of Lord Sigmund: Esmeralda, the
                        outgoing sister; Tia, the bookish and kind sister; and Janeye, the mysterious third sister.
                        Madam Eupheme, a noble of Sarunia was schmoozed by Anthea, but the whole party learned that
                        cultists in the area are bothering her. This was further discussed with Esmeralda, who said that
                        there was a cultist ritual happening in the forest north of the castle. She said that if they
                        could be eliminated, she may be able to procure a reward for the party, seeing as we are well
                        equipped for adventure, and well-known fighters, to boot.</p>

                    <p>Agreeing to take up the quest, the party leaves the castle, as the party is beginning and heads
                        for the woods south of the castle, where shouting was heard before. Splitting up, Finn heads
                        around the noise, behind it; Anthea and Eredor encounter more guards and stay by the road; and
                        lastly, Gilda and Njiaren approach the voices.</p>

                    <p>Gilda, Njairen, and Finn see that there is a cultist ritual occurring, with tens of cultists
                        surrounding a central shape drawn on the ground, and several guards encircling them. Finn
                        notices that there is a hatch locked with magic on the far side of the circle, and returns to
                        the group to report back. Once the party is reunited, they come across guads, who are not so
                        willing to chat this time.</p>

                    <h3>Game 2</h3>
                    <p>Three guards were killed, and two were cast asleep. Philip, one of the sleeping guards, was woken
                        and charmed. When questioned, he divulged that a cultist wearing red robes hired him and several
                        others to protect the black-robed cultists in the center of the forest. The party, along with
                        Philip, head towards the circle in the forest. As they walk, they hear Auriana Owlfeather fall
                        from a tree with a squawk. It was revealed that she was spying on the group, and following her
                        childhood friend, Anthea.</p>
                    <p>All together now, the party encroach on the circle of cultists. All are wearing black robes, and
                        there are 20 or so surrounding a large summoning circle with Infernal writing. Two were knocked
                        out by Athena cast lightning that stunned two people. Philip the newfie then followed the
                        adventurers went down the trapdoor into the hideout of the cultists. The first room was entirely
                        filled with crates, which were plundered by the adventurers and Phil. There was also a sleeping
                        guard present, but he was narrowly avoided. Phil woke from his charmed state and decided to
                        follow the others in order to get his bonus. The adventurers brave on, past a cultist office,
                        dining room full of cultists, and onto a room with a sculpture in the corner.</p>

                    <h3>Game 3</h3>
                    <p>The group follow the hallways until they get to a large circular room. There is a ribbon of light
                        dancing in the center. The group realize that they have come across a celestial being. While at
                        a loss over what to do, Finras approaches the being in order to poke it. Everyone sees as Finras
                        (and later Gilda) approach that a being made of light, is formed.</p>
                    <p>A cultist appears at the entrance, and asks if the "deity" was summoned. The party finds out that
                        the Midsummer ceremony is meant to summon the North Witch, to protect the world from the
                        Neverghast. Every year there is a different location where they do their ritual; they do not ask
                        permission because they do not want to be disturbed, and they steal babies to train them to be
                        cultists. Upset that many cultists were killed, this cultist snaps his fingers and causes the
                        angel to approach the group.</p>

                    <h3>Game 4</h3>
                    <p>The door closed with Njaren, Anthea, and Finras inside, while Eredor, Auriana, and Gilda were
                        knocked outside of the chamber. Inside, the cultist, angel, and half the party attacked each
                        other. The cultist defeated, his last words were a plea to prevent the Neverghast from coming.
                    <p>Outside, Eredor is upset that his friends did not follow him out, and tries to reach them using
                    means near the door. Gilda and Auriana head to the surface and approach different cultists, with
                    limited success.</p>
                    <p>In the chamber, Anthea speaks with the celestial being, but it only speaks celestial. The cultist
                    has a bracelet and a book on his person which describes daily kidnappings of the cult, a description
                    of the North Witch (and how she's a celestial being), as well as notes about a seed from Sarunia
                    being very important. The name of the cult is also discovered; they refer to themselves as the
                    Forward Knights. A decision is made that these cultists should be further researched. A passageway
                    is discovered in the corner of the room, and Anthea, Njairen, and Finras follow it out of the
                    dungeon. The tunnel is log, and it is midday by the time the three are above ground, in Gter, the
                    town beside a lake.</p>
                    <p>Auriana and Gilda approach Lord Sigmund, hoping to get assistance finding their friends, but relay a
                    classist distaste from Gilda towards Auriana. Both leave.</p>
